# Project
## Exercise 1:
- Develop a dashboard where you can visualize data obtained through a public API. Use Vue.js JavaScript framework.
## Exercise 2:
- Imagine that exercise 1 is a real enterprise project, but instead of consisting only of a frontend and read from a public API, we have to create a backend service to read from a web service (created by us), relational database and a dashboard (frontend). In this case, instead of developing it yourself, you have a team of 2 people (one backend person + one frontend person) in your charge and you have to explain the project to each one and break down phases, milestones and tasks (you can set a duration of 3 months for the project). In addition to exercise 1, a Python microservice is required to analyze the data.

## Task 1: Draw a diagram of the project architecture.

## Task 2: Break down phases, tasks and milestones to organize the two-person team.
